# hello-world
hello world sounds very dorky. But less dorky than my current Git skills I don't Got.
In fact, I'm sitting here wondering how dorky we will all feel after the Internet Apocalypse. For some reason, the final section of David Mitchell's "The Bone Clocks" brought this home to me in a way that other thinking/discussing/reading hadn't. It just seemed real. Even though there were weird atemporal characters at the heart of the story. Maybe I should just shut down the computer and make my garden grow.
